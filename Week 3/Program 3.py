Modify your greeting program so that if the user does not enter a name (i.e. they
just press enter), the program responds "Hello, Stranger!". Otherwise it should print
a greeting with their name as before.

"""
Write a program that simulates the way in which a user might choose a password.
The program should prompt for a new password, and then prompt again. If the two
passwords entered are the same the program should say "Password Set" or
similar, otherwise it should report an error.
